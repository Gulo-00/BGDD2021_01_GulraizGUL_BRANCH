My ambition is to become an artist, using my creativity to preserve culture and folklore through visual storytelling. ART is wisdom. I aim to blend traditional and modern art techniques to bring forgotten stories to life, especially through game design. Through my work, I want to inspire and educate future generations about the rich heritage of my people.
